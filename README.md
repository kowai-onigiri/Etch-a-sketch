# Etch-a-sketch
This project was completed according to The Odin Project curriculum. 

In total, it took me about five hours to complete.

Through this project, I strengthened my ability with DOM manipulation and events. At first, the project appeared daunting, but by breaking down the project's script
into the various functions needed, figuring it out piece by piece became much more managable. 

While my project meets the basic requirements at the moment, I hope to expand on it and make it more functional, interactive, and visually appealing. Two feautures 
that I would like to add specifically are 1) a better designed drawing system that functions more along the lines of drawing when the mouse is pressed down, and 2) a 
visually appealing and perhaps vintage or retro graphic/canvas.
