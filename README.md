# Etch-a-sketch
This project was completed according to The Odin Project curriculum. 

In total, it took me about five hours to complete.

Through this project, I strengthened my ability with DOM manipulation and events. At first, the project appeared daunting, but by breaking down the project's script
into the various functions needed, figuring it out piece by piece became much more managable. 

This project contains a canvas in which the user can drag their mouse across the grid to "draw" in either black or rainbow, depending on which button they choose. 
There is also an erase option for them to drag their mouse across the colored squares and revert them back to their original state. The user can also click the reset 
button to clear the board and choose and new grid size.

While my project meets the basic requirements at the moment, I hope to expand on it and make it more functional, interactive, and visually appealing. Two feautures 
that I would like to add specifically are 1) a better designed drawing system that functions more along the lines of drawing when the mouse is pressed down, and 2) a 
visually appealing and perhaps vintage or retro graphic/canvas.
